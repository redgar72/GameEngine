## Technical Stack
- **Core Engine**: ModernGL + Pyglet
- **3D Graphics**: OpenGL 4.6
- **Physics**: Custom implementation (possibly PyBullet for complex physics)
- **Audio**: Pyglet's audio system
- **Data Storage**: SQLite for game data, JSON for configuration
- **AI**: Custom implementation with potential CUDA acceleration
- **Tools**: Blender for 3D modeling, GIMP for textures

## Development Guidelines
1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control
2. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation
3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for core systems
4. **Performance**: Profile regularly, optimize bottlenecks
5. **Modularity**: Keep systems decoupled for easier maintenance
6. **Cross-Platform**: Ensure compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Next Steps
1. [x] Set up the basic project structure
2. [x] Implement a simple 3D scene with ModernGL and Pyglet
3. [ ] Create a basic camera system
4. [ ] Implement simple input handling
5. [ ] Set up the basic rendering pipeline

## Current Progress
- Basic window creation and OpenGL context setup complete
- Simple triangle rendering working
- Configuration system implemented
- Project structure established

## Notes
- This roadmap is flexible and may be adjusted based on development progress
- Each phase can be developed in parallel to some extent
- Focus on core systems first, then expand to more complex features
- Regular testing and optimization should be performed throughout development
